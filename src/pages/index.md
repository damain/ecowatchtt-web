    On July 7th, 2021 Atlantic LNG was granted a Certificate of Environmental
    Clearance (CEC) from the Environmental Management Agency for the drilling
    and operating of two disposal injection wells at the company’s facility,
    Atlantic Avenue, Point Fortin. The wells will be used for the disposal of
    produced water and processed liquids.


    According to the terms and conditions of the CEC, the company cannot commence work of any kind until the company obtains approvals from ALL statutory and regulatory agencies. Atlantic is also mandated to ensure that every precaution is taken to avoid any form of air, noise and water pollution. Additionally, as part of the approval agreement, the company is required to engage the stakeholders – residents, institutions, businesses etc. – on the scope of work related to the project, effects, restrictions, health and safety measures to be taken, and identification of specific names and contact numbers for the community relations officers.
