ECOWATCH TT is made up of past and present industry professionals, who are experienced in many aspects of upstream, midstream and downstream operations. 


The group was born out of an immediate need to raise awareness on the current issue, of a proposed Class II Deep Well Injection of liquid waste in Trinidad and Tobago’s Point Fortin community. This proposal is being made by the Island’s lone LNG producer, in a time when the international community continues to grapple with the effects of a pandemic which has claimed over 4.55 million lives to date (September 2021).  


This planet as we know it is vitally important to us all. It is where we live, work, play, and raise our families. Its sustainability is crucial to our continued existence here on earth and the survival of every living creature depends on our resources within.  


Global warming is real and we absolutely cannot afford for the continued water pollution, deforestation or air pollution of our world, as we run a great risk of completely destroying or depleting all which we have left. 


We believe that it is our job to create a better world for those who would inherit it and the only way to make that happen is by acting now!
