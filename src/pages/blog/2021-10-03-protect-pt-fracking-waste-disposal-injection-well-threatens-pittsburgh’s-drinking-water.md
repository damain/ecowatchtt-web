The residents of the Allegheny River Valley urgently ask Governor Tom Wolf to exercise his executive power to revoke the permit for the Penneco Sedat #3A class 2 waste disposal well in Plum Borough. 

The well site would present devastating risks to several downstream Allegheny River public drinking water systems, including the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority which provides water to hundreds of thousands of City of Pittsburgh residents and businesses. New scientific evidence suggests there are numerous pathways for pollution. 

**Protect PT**, the Breathe Collaborative and Citizens for Plum are presenting this press conference to highlight the issues.

 Speakers: Gillian Graber, MC, Matt Kelso, Local Plum Resident: Resident concerns and mine subsidence, Dr. Anthony Ingraffea, Ph.D., P.E., Dwight C. Baum Professor of Engineering Emeritus and Weiss Presidential Teaching Fellow at Cornell University: Engineering inadequacies Melissa Troutman, Research & Policy Analyst, EarthWorks, Co-Founder of Public Herald: Radioactivity in fracking waste, Dr. Ned Ketyer, M.D., F.A.A.P Physicians for Social Responsibility and Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project: Health impacts
