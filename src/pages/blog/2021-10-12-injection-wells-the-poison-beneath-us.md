The idea behind deep well injection is to store toxic liquid under layers of rock, preventing it from contaminating the earth’s surface. Studies have shown, however, that this does not always happen. There have been many reports in the US of leakages that have sent toxic waste to the earth’s surface and water sources. So much so, that scientists and regulators have lost count of the number of leaks from the nation’s over 680,000 deep well injections. In addition the health and safety risks involved, research is showing that the drilling produces too much waste and it is changing the geology of the earth, especially with the number of integrity violations found with deep well examinations. Some experts believes these violations, if not addressed, will eventually lead to bigger problems which may turn out to be irreversible.
