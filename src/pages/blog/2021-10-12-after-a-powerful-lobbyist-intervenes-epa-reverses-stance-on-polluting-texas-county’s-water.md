An attempt by Uranium Energy Corp. for authorisation to begin a large-scale mining project in Goliad County, Texas seemed about to be denied by the EPA, until it became political. The company contracted the services of lobbyist Heather Podesta, who had worked with the Obama administration and the approval was granted. Podesta’s firm was paid $400,000 for her services.

The approval raised many questions about the integrity of the EPA, and the decision was challenged as Golaid County is not a remote location and residents source their water from many wells that tap into an aquifer near the proposed site of the new mine. Additionally, two geologic faults run through the potential site, making it easy for waste migration to nearby zones and the surface.
