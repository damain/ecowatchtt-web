In the poor community of DeBerry, Texas quite of number of oil and gas companies have set up injection wells to deposit their waste. Members of the community frequently complain that their potable water is polluted and one resident, Rev. David Hudson has been trying to get authorities to investigate the cause of the pollution for over ten years. 
Samples of the water has been tested and the results reveal it contains high levels of substances that comes from drilling waste, causing members of the community to resort to buying bottled water. But after years of testing, political red tape and conflicting reports, Rev. Hudson and the residents of DeBerry are no closer to getting a definitive answer as to the source of the pollution.
